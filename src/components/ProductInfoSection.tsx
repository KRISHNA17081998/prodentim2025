                ProDentim Dietary Supplements contain different strains of good bacteria that scientists have studied extensively. Our pills are designed to make your gums and teeth stronger and fight against things that can harm them. Normal oral care products like toothpaste and mouthwash sometimes remove the good bacteria, upsetting the natural balance in your mouth.

                ProDentim is created to replace the good bacteria, reduce harmful things, and keep your mouth wet. By keeping a healthy balance of good bacteria, ProDentim helps break down food bits and remove bad bacteria, which stops possible oral problems. The supplement has a neutral pH, which helps good bacteria grow and makes your teeth and gums stronger.
